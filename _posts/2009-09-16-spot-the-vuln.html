<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Purpose</strong></h2>
spotthevuln.com was created by <a href="http://spotthevuln.com/about-spot-the-vuln/">two security professionals</a> who wanted to give something back to the community. The intent of this blog is to provide examples of real world vulnerabilities affecting real world software. The examples provided are from open source software packages with the focus being on web applications.

We hope security professionals find the blog interesting, but we also hope to reach non-security professionals across multiple disciplines including development, quality assurance, and management. Individuals who are looking for a quick security challenge or an introduction to reviewing code from a security perspective.

<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Logistics</strong></h2>
The samples will cover various coding languages and a variety of issues. We will post a vulnerable code snippet every <strong>Monday at 8am (PST)</strong>. The solution to the vulnerable code will be posted on the following <strong>Friday at 8am (PST)</strong>.

If you plan on using samples from this blog as a part of a formal course of instruction or a teaching aid, you can count on one (1) vulnerability along with its solution to be presented every week.

Please feel free to leave your thoughts and comments on the blog. Your comments can cover vulnerabilities and/or the solutions. <strong>All comments from readers will be held in moderation until the code fix is posted on Friday</strong> to avoid the possibility of spoilers.
<h2><strong>Quality of Code Fixes / Solutions</strong></h2>
Please remember, the authors of this blog <strong><em>DID NOT</em></strong> write the code fixes that will be posted. Instead, we simply present the code fix developed by the affected software development team, along with some analysis of the code fix.

We <em><strong>have no control over</strong> </em>the code fix quality, security robustness, nor can we definitively state why the development teams would choose a certain strategy over another.
<h2><strong>Making the Most of SpotTheVuln</strong></h2>
This blog focuses on source code analysis from a security perspective. The reader should keep in mind that writing code is only one piece of the engineering effort required to create and maintain large complex software projects. The integration of development, quality assurance, and management disciplines are essential in the smooth execution of software creation and maintenance.

Once the solution sets are posted the reader can broaden their perspective by asking themselves questions such as:
<ul>
	<li>Is the code fix implemented by the software organization a good one? Why or why not?</li>
	<li>Why did the organization choose to fix the vulnerability in the manner they did?</li>
	<li>How would you test a code base consisting of 100,000 dynamic pages for similar vulnerabilities?</li>
	<li>How would one test to ensure the fix is robust and comprehensive?</li>
	<li>What testing criteria would make a good quality gate?</li>
	<li>What engineering/administrative/automated gates can be created to ensure similar a vulnerably doesnâ€™t make its way into future code check-ins?</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
We hope you find spotthevuln.com to be a fun way to spend a few minutes each week. If you have any suggestions or would like to submit a vulnerability to the site, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:spotthevuln (shift 2) gmail.com">spotthevuln (shift 2) gmail.com</a> Happy Hunting!
