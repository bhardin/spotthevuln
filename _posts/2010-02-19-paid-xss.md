# Solution: Paid

## Details

* __Affected Software:__ WordPress
* __Fixed in Version:__  1.5.1.3
* __Issue Type:__ XSS

## Description

This particular issue was a super simple XSS affecting WordPress. In this case, the comment parameter is taken directly from the querystring here:

```
$comment = $_GET['comment'];
```

and used to build HTML markup here:

```
echo "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"comment\" value=\"$comment\" />\n";
```

The WordPress developers fixed this particular issue by casting `$comment` to an integer. `$comment` should only refer to a specific index for a comment and should never contain text. This change was made in several places in the same file in an attempt to harden the code against XSS. Our previous example showed that implementing HTML filtering near the point of consumption could be useful during code audits. In this example, we see that some simple sanitization at variable assignment can also go a long way.

There is a curious detail here. In this example, `$comment` is assigned a value directly from the query string (attacker controlled). Immediately below the vulnerable `$comment` assignment is another variable assignment, this time for a variable named `$p` (I assume "p" stands for "page number"). `$p` is already cast to integer before being used elsewhere to build HTML markup. It's surprising that the WordPress developers would cast one variable to integer, while ignoring the second when the initial code was created.

## Developer's Solution

```diff
<?
$comment_status = $commentdata['comment_approved'];

include('edit-form-comment.php');

break;

case 'confirmdeletecomment':

require_once('./admin-header.php');

- $comment = $_GET['comment'];
+ $comment = (int) $_GET['comment'];

$p = (int) $_GET['p'];

$commentdata = get_commentdata($comment, 1, true) or die(sprintf(__('Oops, no comment with this ID. <a href="%s">Go back</a>!'), 'edit.php'));

if (!user_can_delete_post_comments($user_ID, $commentdata['comment_post_ID'])) {

die( __('You are not allowed to delete comments on this post.') );

}

echo "<div class=\"wrap\">\n";

echo "<p>" . __('<strong>Caution:</strong> You are about to delete the following comment:') . "</p>\n";

echo "<table border=\"0\">\n";

echo "<tr><td>" . __('Author:') . "</td><td>" . $commentdata["comment_author"] . "</td></tr>\n";

echo "<tr><td>" . __('E-mail:') . "</td><td>" . $commentdata["comment_author_email"] . "</td></tr>\n";

echo "<tr><td>". __('URL:') . "</td><td>" . $commentdata["comment_author_url"] . "</td></tr>\n";

echo "<tr><td>". __('Comment:') . "</td><td>" . stripslashes($commentdata["comment_content"]) . "</td></tr>\n";

echo "</table>\n";

echo "<p>" . __('Are you sure you want to do that?') . "</p>\n";

echo "<form action='".get_settings('siteurl')."/wp-admin/post.php' method='get'>\n";

echo "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"deletecomment\" />\n";

echo "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"p\" value=\"$p\" />\n";

echo "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"comment\" value=\"$comment\" />\n";

echo "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"noredir\" value=\"1\" />\n";

echo "<input type=\"submit\" value=\"" . __('Yes') . "\" />";

echo "&nbsp;&nbsp;";

echo "<input type=\"button\" value=\"" . __('No') . "\" onclick=\"self.location='". get_settings('siteurl') ."/wp-admin/edit.php?p=$p&c=1#comments';\" />\n";

echo "</form>\n";

echo "</div>\n";

break;

case 'deletecomment':

</div>
