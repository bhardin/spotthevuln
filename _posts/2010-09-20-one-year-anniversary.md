<h2>Today is Spot the Vuln's Birthday! Woot!</h2>
STV has now been online for one year and we would like to do a reverse birthday where we give something away to our readers.

Starting right now and going until the end of the week you have a chance to win a <strong>signed copy</strong> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Next-Generation-Animal-Guide/dp/0596154577">Hacking: The Next Generation</a>.
<h2>A Contest You Say</h2>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Next-Generation-Animal-Guide/dp/0596154577" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" title="HTNG" src="http://covers.oreilly.com/images/9780596154585/lrg.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="328" /></a>

Not only are we giving one away, but we are giving two away! We're even going to pay for shipping!

A book will be given away randomly to one person in each category below.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tweet a message with the hash tag, #SpotTheVuln. (Couldn't be easier)</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Post a video, podcast, or write a blog post on how STV can help developers understand security better. It can be funny, serious, or make no sense at all. Then tagback or pingback to this post.</strong></li>
</ul>
We are glad you read Spot The Vuln and we can't wait to bring it to even more people, so that we can all feel safer.

Look forward to reading, watching, listening to all you have to say.
