Billy Rios is currently a Security Engineer for a Major Software firm that everyone LOVES. Billy helps secure software used by people all over the world. Before Billy's current role as a Security Engineer, He was a Senior Security Consultant for VeriSign. Billy performed network, application, web-application, source-code, wireless, Internet, Intranet, dial-up, and social engineering security reviews and security architecture design services for various clients in the Fortune 500. 

Most importantly, he helps clients understand the existing and emerging security risks that their businesses face so that they can make an informed business decision.

Prior to joining VeriSign, Billy worked as a penetration tester for E&Y's Advanced Security Center, breaking into information systems and helping clients in the Fortune 500 understand existing and emerging security risks.

Before his life as a consultant, Billy helped defend Department of Defense networks as an Intrusion Detection Analyst. Billy looked at packets, monitored for suspicious network activity, took apart malicious code, and formally reported network and security incidents of all shapes and sizes. The crew he worked with at the CERT are some of the sharpest, most creative problem solvers he has ever met and many of them helped shape my perception of information security. Before attacking and defending networks, Billy was an active duty Marine Officer (Semper FI!). He spent some time in a hot desert, carried a side arm (sometimes a machine gun), and got real up-close and personal with physical and operational security.

Billy has an undergraduate degree in Business (with a formal concentration in Information Systems) from the University of Washington (GO HUSKIES!) and a Master of Science Degree in Information Systems (with Distinction) from Hawaii Pacific University. Billy recently completed his MBA to help balance out his geeky tendencies.
